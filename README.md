# Challenge 1

## Description

In this exercise we took existing HTML and CSS code for a functional website and made improvements to the HTML by updating semantic elements, improving logical structure and adding "alt" attributes to improve accessability. The overall object was to improve readability while maintaining existing functionality.

## Credits

No explicit credits to add since this challenged focused on refactoring existing code.
